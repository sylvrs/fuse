# fuse
Fuse is a simple, multi-guild Discord bot library built in Go. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend through its service functionality.


## BEWARE!
This library is still in development and is not ready for production use. It is currently being used in a few projects but isn't fully equipped for public use.

Many systems involved in this library are not fully fleshed out and contain ugly code. This will be fixed in the future but for now, use at your own risk.
